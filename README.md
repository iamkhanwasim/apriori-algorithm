# apriori-algorithm
**Apriori Algorithm**  is based on Association Rules Learning which identifies patterns, connections and dependencies between objects.Apriori Algorithmm was Introduced by Rakesh Agrawal and Ramakrishna Srikantha. Apriori algorithm is based on Apriori property which states that a frequent itemset must have frequent subset or conversely if any itemset is infrequent then all the superset must also be infrequent. This algorithm iterates over to identify k itemset which occur together frequently in the dataset and then uses k itemset to iterate next to identify k+1 itemset
